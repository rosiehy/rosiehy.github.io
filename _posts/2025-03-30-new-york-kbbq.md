one of my new york trip's best bites

NUBIANI - Koreatown, New York
======

Tucked in the heart of Koreatown, *Nubiani* delivers one of the best Korean BBQ experiences Iâ€™ve had in New York. We ordered the beef and pork combo, and every cut was rich, tender, and grilled to perfection. The pork belly had the ideal crisp-to-fat ratio, while the marinated beef practically melted.

What really stood out was the **mushroom rice** â€” subtly earthy, comforting, and served in a hot stone bowl that added the perfect crispy bottom layer. It balanced the grilled meats beautifully.

And the **banchan**? Fantastic. From tangy pickled cucumbers to savory fish cake strips, every small plate felt intentional and fresh. I definitely asked for refills. Also, the jiggly egg that it comes with, fantastic!

ðŸ”¥ **Top Bite:** Grilled pork belly + mushroom rice = harmony.  
ðŸ¥¢ **Pro Tip:** Let the rice sit for a crispy crust before mixing.

Highly recommend for anyone looking to BBQ their way through NYC.
