Hi, I’m Rosie Li. I’m currently pursuing a [Master in Financial Engineering at Cornell University](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/programs/graduate-programs/financial-engineering), where I spend my days modeling volatility surfaces, building trading strategies, and debugging in Python. Before this, I studied [Financial Economics and Risk, Data & Financial Engineering](https://econ.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/), which I attended after growing up in Vancouver, Canada. I’ve always been fascinated by how markets move — and how data and human behavior intersect to explain those movements. When I’m not deep in code or market structure, I’m probably thinking about my next meal.

Over the past few years, I’ve traveled to Tokyo, Hangzhou, New York, Boston, Vancouver, Cabo, Chiang Mai, Helsinki, Copenhagen, and Oslo — not just to see the world, but to taste it. From Omakase in Shinjuku to midnight noodles in Chiang Mai, I’ve been on a quest to explore cultures through their cuisine.

I document my food adventures on [Beli](https://beliapp.co/app/rosiehy), my favorite app for logging unforgettable bites and tracking my culinary wanderlust. My reviews are honest, slightly dramatic, and sometimes written while still chewing. I’m proud to say my palate is globally informed and locally curious.

My favorite cuisines? A tough call — but Japanese and Chinese food are easily top-tier in my flavor rankings. (Special shoutout to soup dumplings, Wagyu beef, and toro sashimi.)

Outside of eating (and occasionally coming up for air), I love discovering cozy coffee shops, decoding menus in languages I don’t speak, and conducting serious research on dessert-to-main-course ratios.
