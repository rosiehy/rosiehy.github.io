### Cooking Conversations: A Taste of China  
*Final Project for AMES 107: Narrating East Asia through Word and Image*

For this project, I created a personal food journal documenting the meals I cooked and ate each day, blending daily storytelling with cultural exploration. The project culminated in a shared dinner where I prepared traditional Chinese dishes for friends and interviewed them before and after the meal. 

Through these conversations, I explored their perceptions of Chinese cuisine and culture, and reflected on how food can serve as both a cultural bridge and a narrative medium. The final product included a cooking video, meal footage, and dialogue excerpts â€” offering a taste of China through my lens and my kitchen.
